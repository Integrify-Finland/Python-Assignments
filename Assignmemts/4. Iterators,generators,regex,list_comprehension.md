**Python Basics: Iters and generators,regex, comprehension**

1. [Iterator](https://realpython.com/python-iterators-iterables/) and [generator](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/): (For advanced learners, read from the links )
  a. As you have already known, the iterables objects are the stream of data like string,list, dict, set etc which can be looped over or iterated. Since you have also known that you can convert an iterable into an iterator using iter method and iterators have next method, it's time to play around with the builtin itertools module.
  - 1. Create a list apply iter method to it and run next method until you get **StopIteration** error
  - 2. Import **itertools** in your notebook and create infinite iterators using **count,cycle and and repeat methods.** Refer [https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)
  - 3. Use methods from I **terators terminating on the shortest input sequence**
  - 4. User methods from **Combinatoric iterator**
  b. Create an infinite generator that generates the fibonacci series

a. Regular expression:
  - 1. Read and practices more on regex [https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/re/](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/re/)

b. Comprehension:
  - 1. Read different types of comprehension in python [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comprehensions-in-python/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comprehensions-in-python/)
  - 2. Write a multiplication table of any given number in a list using list comprehension
  - 3. Find all numbers from 1 to 500 that has 5 in them
  - 4. Given the list of items=["apple",True,10,"banana",20,30,4.0,"grapes","laptop","phone", False,0], generate the list of non-string values
  - 5. Generate the boolean True for numeric and False for non-numeric in above items list
  - 6. files=["cat1.png","dog1.png","cat2.png","cat3.png","cat4.png","dog2.png","cat5.png","cat6.png","dog3.png"], generate two lists of cat and dog image files
  - 7. Use appropriate comprehension method to generate the complementary dna template using information form 8.b
  - 8. Run the following command in your notebook. What could be the reason the list comprehension is more elegant?
